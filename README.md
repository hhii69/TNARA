# TNARA

The Player’s Journey:

The player begins the game as a night guard, tasked with watching over Ruby’s Arcade during the late hours. As they struggle to survive each night, they uncover Jarvas’s twisted past and the horrifying fate of those who dared enter the arcade. The deeper they go, the more they realize that escaping is not an option. Ruby, TJ, and Jumpy are no longer machines—they are monsters. And they are hungry.

Every night, the player learns more about the animatronics' insidious nature, while the line between reality and nightmare begins to blur. The arcade becomes a prison, and no one has ever left. Good luck!
